# Database of Dance
Virtual archive of dance videos using flask templates to dynamically populate the webpage content and pandas to manage a csv database. The webscraping script appears to have been lost, but the repository still contains its resulting .csv file.

**Note:** Due to the structure of the website being scraped being formatted differently for certain sections, some of the sections on this website have improper labeling (like the salsa & cha cha section).  


Thanks to Nick and Melissa Enge for creating the videos and being great teachers (libraryofdance.org), and thanks to my friend James Speller for handling the webscraping.
